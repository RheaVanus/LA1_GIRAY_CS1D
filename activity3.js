let isJsProgrammingLanguage = true; // This line declares a variable named isJsProgrammingLanguage. It stores a boolean value of true which indicates that Js or Javascript is a programming language.

console.log(isJsProgrammingLanguage); //This prints the boolean value "true".
console.log(isJsHard)//This prints the boolean value "false".
console.log(favNumb)// This prints the number value of 9.
console.log(result);//This prints the NaN (Not a Number) since we are adding 9 to undefined, and undefined is not a number that's why it won't add the two values.
